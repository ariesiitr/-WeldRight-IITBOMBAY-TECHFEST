# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Participants are expected to use ML models to predict welding defects in the materials by
developing algorithms using the provided parameters. Participants are free to use any
technique provided it is suited for the variety and volume of data provided.
The end goal of this competition is to enable the Godrej Aerospace team to produce
defect-free products every time.
# DATA PROVIDED
We have identified multiple parameters affecting the welding process and recorded the
dataset from past activities. Process parameters such as ambient temperature, weld job
temperature, humidity, voltage current, welding travel speed, shielding gas flow, and metal
composition. For advanced analytics machine data, welder details are provided.
